Process:


HTML File:

First take html file and then divide webpage into containers
And name the container using class
And in the container we have to define elements based on requirement

And then CSS file 
Take * for resetting the properties initially
Then root {}, we can define few values and use further

Then take body then container then individual elements

Then finally come to javascript file:

Create an empty array named tasks
let tasks = [];
Then added the task to the tasks array using addTask function
But we have update the task to page, using updateTaskList function
We called UpdateTaskList function in addTask function, because once we added the task we have to update it to page

But before addTask and updateTaskList, we have to click + button.
After clicking + button we have to call addTask and updateTaskList
Generally for button it has default behavior so we have to prevent that (using eventListener) and call addTask method

If we describe javascript file the process will be like

We have coded one functionality that is when we are entering text in the input box 
and click on + button, task element need to be added at the bottom, if we add 10 tasks
10 task elelments needs to be added and 
it should contain one checkbox and text what we have entered in the textbox and 
one edit button and delete button.
If we click  on check box progress should be reflected based on the ratio
and when we click on edit element task element will be removed and the text from the task element
will be moved to input text box we used to enter task text
Then once we click on delete button task will be removed and progress will be updated
Finally once we complete all the listed tasks it should blast confetti.


Finaly try to get in to code and try to decode.

Process:


HTML File:

First take html file and then divide webpage into containers
And name the container using class
And in the container we have to define elements based on requirement

And then CSS file 
Take * for resetting the properties initially
Then root {}, we can define few values and use further

Then take body then container then individual elements

Then finally come to javascript file:

Create an empty array named tasks
let tasks = [];
Then added the task to the tasks array using addTask function
But we have update the task to page, using updateTaskList function
We called UpdateTaskList function in addTask function, because once we added the task we have to update it to page

But before addTask and updateTaskList, we have to click + button.
After clicking + button we have to call addTask and updateTaskList
Generally for button it has default behavior so we have to prevent that (using eventListener) and call addTask method
